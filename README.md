Deployability of Content-Centric Networking
======

Final project of the Measuring and Simulating the Internet (ET4285) course at TU Delft, The Netherlands (2013)

Investigation of factors and parameters such as content to cache, cache size, and content caching
under changing link conditions that must be taken into account while deploying CCN in the present internet. We also compare CCN with the present internet architecture (TCP/IP) under different real world scenarios. Different tests and measurements were performed on both CCNx (CCN based open source experimental project) and HTTP (TCP/IP based network communication protocol) under different scenarios by simulating real world networks in our measurement setups.
